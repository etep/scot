This file list the things that were changed from the previous version
of ciropt to clean it and remove old things.

1> remove the simply_minimize option and its associated models and 
parsing directives from all files.


2> implementing deuniquify for which made another variable called 
var_name to be used to prefix the WN WP, etc variables. var_name can
be same for deuiquified nodes so that they can get sized the same way.

3> Including default activity factor (in addition to min_act_fact) for the nets which do not happen to be initialized or if the .power section is not given or something.

4> including duty factor support for the gates (like activity factors are
for nets).
